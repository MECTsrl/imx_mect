    \title Setting Up Debugger

    The main debugger settings are associated with the
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} you build and run your project with. To specify the
    debugger and compiler to use for each kit, select \gui Tools >
    \gui Options > \gui {Build and Run} > \gui Kits.

    You need to set up the debugger only if the automatic setup
    fails, because the native debugger is missing (as is usually the
    case for the CDB debugger on Windows, which you always must install
    yourself) or because the installed version is not supported (for example,
    when your system contains no, or an outdated version of GDB and you
    want to use a locally installed replacement instead).

    \note If you need to change the debugger to use for an automatically
    detected \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit},
    you can \gui{Clone} the kit and change the parameters in
    the clone. Make sure to select the cloned kit for your project.

    \note To use the debugging tools for Windows, you must install them
    and add the Symbol Server provided by Microsoft to the symbol search
    path of the debugger. For more information, see \l{Setting the Symbol
    Server in Windows}.

    \note To use the Free Software Foundation (FSF) version of GDB on
    Mac OS, you must sign it and modify your \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} settings.

    This section explains the options you have for debugging C++ code
    and provides installation notes for the supported native debuggers.
    It also applies for code in other compiled languages such as C,
    FORTRAN, Ada.

    For more information on the debugger modes, see
    \l{Launching the Debugger in Different Modes}.

    \section1 Supported Native Debugger Versions

    Qt Creator supports native debuggers when working with
    compiled code. On most supported platforms, the GNU Symbolic Debugger
    GDB can be used. On Microsoft Windows, when using the Microsoft tool chain
    the Microsoft Console Debugger CDB, is needed. There is also an
    incomplete experimental interface to LLDB on Mac OS and Linux available
    when building \QC from source.

    The following table summarizes the support for debugging C++ code:

    \table
        \header
            \li Platform
            \li Compiler
            \li Native Debugger
        \row
            \li Linux
            \li GCC, ICC

            \li GDB
    \endtable

    \section2 Supported GDB Versions

    GDB comes in two varieties with common roots.

    One is used on Mac OS X and does not support Python as scripting language.
    The minimal supported versions in is GDB 6.3.50-20050815, build 1469.

    The second is maintained by the Free Software Foundation, and can
    use Python as scripting language. The minimal supported version
    in this case is FSF GDB 7.4.1, using Python version 2.6 or 2.7.
    Note that Python 3.x is not supported by GDB.

    The Python enabled versions are very convenient to interface,
    and much of \QC's advanced data display options depend on the
    availability of Python scripting. Since Python enabled versions
    of GDB are bundled with all recent Linux versions, active
    support for non-Python builds has been dropped for platforms
    other than Mac OS X.

    The non-Python versions use the compiled version of the debugging
    helpers, that you must enable separately. For more information, see
    \l{Debugging Helpers Based on C++}.

    The Python version uses a script version of the debugging helpers
    that does not need any special setup.

    FSF GDB can also be compiled for Mac OS, but the build is currently
    unstable, and thererefore, this is not recommended.

    \section2 Supported CDB Versions

    The CDB native debugger has similar functionality to the non-Python GDB
    debugger engine. Specifically, it also uses compiled C++ code for the
    debugging helper library.

    \section2 Supported LLDB Versions

    The LLDB native debugger has similar functionality to the GDB debugger.
    LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on Mac OS X for supporting C++ on the
    desktop. LLDB is typically used with the Clang compiler (even though you
    can use it with GCC, too).

    You can use the LLDB version delivered with Xcode, but we recommend that you
    build it from sources using Xcode. The minimal supported version is LLDB
    300.99.

    \section2 GDB Adapter Modes

    [Advanced Topic]

    The GDB native debugger used internally by the debugger plugin runs in
    different adapter modes to cope with the variety of supported platforms and
    environments. All GDB adapters inherit from  AbstractGdbAdapter:

    \list

        \li PlainGdbAdapter debugs locally started GUI processes. It is
            physically split into parts that are relevant only when Python is
            available, parts relevant only when Python is not available, and
            mixed code.

        \li TermGdbAdapter debugs locally started processes that need a
            console.

        \li AttachGdbAdapter debugs local processes started outside \QC.

        \li CoreGdbAdapter debugs core files generated from crashes.

        \li RemoteGdbAdapter interacts with the GDB server running on Linux.

    \endlist

    \endomit

    \section1 Installing Native Debuggers

    Check the table below for the supported versions and other important
    information about installing native debuggers.

    \table
        \header
            \li Native Debugger
            \li Notes
        \row
            \li GDB
            \li On Linux and Windows, use the Python-enabled GDB versions that
                are installed when you install \QC and Qt SDK. On Mac OS X,
                use the GDB provided with Xcode.
                You can also build your own Python-enabled GDB. Follow the instructions in
                \l{http://qt-project.org/wiki/QtCreatorBuildGdb}
                {Building GDB}.

        \row
            \li Debugging tools for Windows
            \li To use this engine, you must install the
                \e{Debugging tools for Windows}. You can download them from
                \l{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463009/}
                {Download and Install Debugging Tools for Windows}.

                \note Visual Studio does not include the Debugging tools needed,
                and therefore, you must install them separately.

                The pre-built \QSDK for Windows makes use of the library if it
                is present on the system. When manually building \QC using
                the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, the build process checks for
                the required files in
                \c{"%ProgramFiles%\Debugging Tools for Windows"}.

                It is highly recommended that you add the Symbol Server provided
                by Microsoft to the symbol search path of the debugger. The
                Symbol Server provides you with debugging informaton for the
                operating system libraries for debugging Windows applications.
                For more information, see
                \l{Setting the Symbol Server in Windows}.

       \row
            \li Debugging tools for Mac OS X
            \li The Qt binary distribution contains both debug and release
                variants of the libraries. But you have to explicitly tell the
                runtime linker that you want to use the debug libraries even if
                your application is compiled as debug, as release is the default
                library.

                If you use a qmake based project in \QC,  you can set a
                flag in your \l{glossary-run-config}{run configuration}, in
                \gui Projects mode. In the run configuration, select
                \gui{Use debug version of frameworks}.

                For more detailed information about debugging on the Mac OS X,
                see: \l{http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn2124/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003391}
                {Mac OS X Debugging Magic}.

              \note The Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) has a bug that might cause the
              application to crash. For a workaround, see:
              \l{http://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-4962}{QTBUG-4962}.

       \row
            \li LLDB
            \li An LLDB version is delivered with Xcode, but we recommend that
                you build LLDB from sources using Xcode.
    \endtable

    \section1 Mapping Source Paths

    To enable the debugger to step into the code and display the source code
    when using a copy of the source tree at a location different from the one
    at which the libraries where built, map the source paths to target paths:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Debugger > \gui General >
            \gui Add.

        \li In the \gui {Source path} field, specify the source path in the
            debug information of the executable as reported by the debugger.

        \li In the \gui {Target path} field, specify the actual location of the
            source tree on the local machine.

    \endlist

    \section1 Setting the Symbol Server in Windows

    To obtain debugging information for the operating system libraries for
    debugging Windows applications, add the Symbol Server provided
    by Microsoft to the symbol search path of the debugger:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Debugger > \gui CDB.

        \li In the \gui {Symbol paths} field, open the \gui Insert menu
            and select \gui{Symbol Server}.

        \li Select a directory where you want to store the cached information
            and click \gui OK.

            Use a subfolder in a temporary directory, such as
            \c {C:\temp\symbolcache}.

    \endlist

    \note Populating the cache might take a long time on a slow network
    connection.

    \note The first time you start debugging by using the Debugging tools for
    Windows, \QC prompts you to add the Symbol Server.

    \section1 Setting up FSF GDB for Mac OS

    To use FSF GDB on Mac OS, you must sign it and add it to the \QC
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits}.

    \list 1

        \li To create a key for signing FSF GDB, select \gui {Keychain Access >
            Certificate Assistant > Create a Certificate}:

        \list 1

            \li In the \gui {Name} field, input \gui {fsfgdb} to replace
                the existing content.

            \li In the \gui {Certificate Type} field, select
                \gui {Code Signing}.

            \li Select the \gui {Let me override defaults} check box.

            \li Select \gui Continue, and follow the instructions of the
                wizard (use the default settings), until the \gui {Specify a
                Location For The Certificate} dialog opens.

            \li In the \gui Keychain field, select \gui System.

            \li Select \gui {Keychain Access > System}, and locate the
                certificate.

            \li Double click the certificate to view certificate information.

            \li In the \gui Trust section, select \gui {Always Trust} in the
                \gui {When using this certificate} field, and then close
                the dialog.

        \endlist

        \li To sign the binary, enter the following command in the terminal:

            \code
            codesign -f -s "fsfgdb" $INSTALL_LOCATION/fsfgdb
            \endcode

        \li In \QC, select \gui {Qt Creator > Preferences > Build & Run >
            Kits} > \gui Add to create a kit that uses FSF GDB.

            \li In the \gui Debugger field, specify the path to FSF GDB
                (\c $HOME/gdb72/bin/fsfgdb, but with an explicit value for
                \c $HOME).

        \li To use the debugger, add the kit in the \gui {Build Settings}
            of the project.

    \endlist

    \section1 Setting Up Experimental LLDB Support

    To use the experimental interface to LLDB, you must set up a kit that uses
    the LLDB engine and select the kit for your project:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui Kits.

        \li Select an automatically created kit in the list, and then select
            \gui Clone to create a copy of the kit.

        \li In the \gui Debugger field, select \gui Edit to change the
            automatically detected debugger to LLDB Engine.

        \li In the \gui Engine field, select \gui {LLDB Engine}.

        \li Select \gui Choose to set the path to the LLDB engine in the
            \gui Binary field.

        \li To use the debugger, add the kit in the \gui {Build Settings}
            of the project.

    \endlist
