    \title Semantic Highlighting

    \QC understands the C++, QML, and JavaScript languages as code, not as plain
    text.
    It reads the source code, analyzes it, and highlights it based on the
    semantic checks that it does for the following code elements:

    \list

        \li Types (such as classes, structs, and type definitions)

        \li Local variables

        \li Class fields

        \li Virtual methods

    \endlist

    To specify the color scheme to use for semantic highlighting, select
    \gui {Tools > Options > Text Editor > Fonts & Color}.

    \QC supports syntax highlighting also for other types of files than
    C++, QML, or JavaScript.

    \section1 Generic Highlighting

    Generic highlighting is based on highlight definition files that are
    provided by the
    \l{http://kate-editor.org/2005/03/24/writing-a-syntax-highlighting-file/}
    {Kate Editor}. You can download highlight definition files for use with \QC.
    For more information about the definition files, see
    \l{http://kde-files.org/index.php?xcontentmode=680}{KDE-Files.org}.

    If you have a Unix installation that comes with the Kate Editor, you might
    already have the definition files installed. Typically, the files are
    located in a read-only directory, and therefore, you cannot manage them. \QC
    can try to locate them and use them as fallback files, when the
    primary location does not contain the definition for the current file type.
    You can also specify the directory that contains preinstalled highlight
    definition files as the primary location.

    When you open a file for editing and the editor cannot find the highlight
    definition for it, an alert appears. To suppress the alerts, you can specify
    patterns for ignoring files.

    To download highlight definition files:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {Tools > Options > Text Editor > Generic
            Highlighter}.

            \image qtcreator-generic-highlighter.png "Generic Highlighter options"

        \li In the \gui Location field, specify the path to the primary
            location for highlight definition files.

        \li Click \gui {Download Definitions} to open a list of highlight
            definition files available for download.

            \image qtcreator-manage-definitions.png "Download Definitions dialog"

        \li Select highlight definition files in the list and click
            \gui {Download Selected Definitions}.

        \li Select the \gui {Use fallback location} check box to specify the
            secondary location where the editor will look for highlight
            definition files.

        \li Click \gui Autodetect to allow \QC to look for highlight
            definition files on your system, or click \gui Browse to locate
            them in the file system yourself.

        \li In the \gui {Ignored file patterns} field, specify file patterns to
            suppress alerts if the highlight definitions for the
            specified files are not found.

        \li Click \gui OK to save your changes.

    \endlist

    \section1 Highlighting and Folding Blocks

    Use block highlighting to visually separate parts of the code that belong
    together. For example, when you place the cursor within the braces,
    the code enclosed in braces is highlighted.

    \image qtcreator-blockhighlighting.png

    To enable block highlighting, select \gui Tools > \gui{Options} >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Display > \gui{Highlight blocks}.

    Use the folding markers to collapse and expand blocks of code within
    braces. Click the folding marker to collapse or expand a block. In the
    figure above, the folding markers are located between the line number and
    the text pane.

    To show the folding markers, select \gui Tools > \gui{Options} >
    \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Display > \gui{Display folding markers}. This
    option is enabled by default.

    When the cursor is on a brace, the matching brace is animated
    by default. To turn off the animation and just highlight the block and
    the braces, select \gui {Tools > Options > Text Editor > Display} and
    deselect \gui {Animate matching parentheses}.

    \title Checking Code Syntax

    As you write code, \QC checks code syntax. When \QC spots a syntax error in
    your code it underlines it and shows error details when you move the mouse
    pointer over the error.
    Similarly, when you are working on an instance of a JavaScript object
    notation (JSON) entity, \QC underlines errors in JSON data structure.

    \list

        \li Syntax errors are underlined in red.

            In the following figure, a semicolon is missing at the end of the
            line.

            \image qtcreator-syntaxerror.png

        \li Semantic errors and warnings are underlined in olive.

            In the following figure, the variable is not used.

            \image qtcreator-semanticerror.png

    \endlist

    In addition, you can run static checks on the QML and JavaScript code in
    your project to find common problems.

    \section1 Checking JSON Data Structure

    \QC validates instances of JSON entities against
    \l{http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03}
    {A JSON Media Type for Describing the Structure and Meaning of JSON Documents}.
    However, this feature is still under development, and \QC does not yet
    understand the entire specification.

    A JSON schema defines the structure of JSON data. It determines what JSON
    data is required for an application and how to interact with it.

    The specification does not define how to map JSON instances with JSON
    schemas. As a temporary solution, \QC looks for a JSON schema file with a
    name that matches the name of the JSON instance file in the user
    configuration folder. For example, \c {~/config/QtProject/qtcreator/json} on
    Linux and Mac OS and
    \c {C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QtCreator\qtcreator\json}
    in Windows. To check JSON data structure, copy the JSON schema file to the
    above folder.

    \section1 Checking JavaScript and QML Syntax

    To run the checks, select \gui {Tools > QML/JS > Run Checks} or press
    \key Ctrl+Shift+C. The results are shown in the \gui {QML Analysis}
    filter of the \gui {Issues} output pane.


    \section1 List of JavaScript and QML Checks

    Many of the JavaScript checks are similar to the ones in Douglas
    Crockford's JSLint tool and are explained well on
    \l{http://www.jslint.com/lint.html}{the JSLint website}.

    \title Completing Code

    As you write code, \QC suggests properties, IDs, and code snippets to
    complete the code. It provides a list of context-sensitive suggestions to
    the statement currently under your cursor. Press \key Tab
    or \key Enter to accept the selected suggestion and complete the code.

    \image qtcreator-codecompletion.png

    To open the list of suggestions at any time, press \key{Ctrl+Space}.
    If only one option is available, \QC inserts it automatically.

    When completion is invoked manually, \QC completes the common prefix
    of the list of suggestions. This is especially useful for classes with
    several similarly named members. To disable this functionality, uncheck
    \gui{Autocomplete common prefix} in the code completion preferences.
    Select \gui Tools > \gui{Options} > \gui{Text Editor} > \gui Completion.

    By default, code completion considers only the first letter case-sensitive.
    To apply full or no case-sensitivity, select the option in the
    \gui {Case-sensitivity} field.

    \section2 Completing Code Snippets

    Code snippets can consist of multiple
    variables that you specify values for. Select an item in the list and press
    \key Tab or \key Enter to complete the code. Press \key Tab to
    move between the variables and specify values for them. When you specify a
    value for a variable, all instances of the variable within the snippet
    are renamed.

    \image qmldesigner-code-completion.png "Completing QML code"

    \section2 Editing Code Snippets

    Code snippets specify C++ or QML code constructs. You can add, modify,
    and remove snippets in the snippet editor. To open the editor, select
    \gui {Tools > Options > Text Editor > Snippets}.

    \image qtcreator-edit-code-snippets.png "Snippet options"

    \QC provides you with built-in snippets in the following categories:

    \list

        \li Text snippets, which can contain any text string. For example, code
            comments

        \li C++ code snippets, which specify C++ code constructs

        \li QML code snippets, which specify QML code constructs

    \endlist

    \section3 Adding and Editing Snippets

    Select a snippet in the list to edit it in the snippet editor. To add a new
    snippet, select \gui Add. Specify a trigger and, if the trigger is already
    in use, an optional variant, which appear in the list of suggestions when
    you write code. Also specify a text string or C++ or QML code construct in
    the snippet editor, depending on the snippet category.

    The snippet editor provides you with:

    \list

        \li Highlighting

        \li Indentation

        \li Parentheses matching

        \li Basic code completion

    \endlist

    Specify the variables for the snippets in the following format:

    \c $variable$

    Use unique variable names within a snippet, because all instances of a
    variable are renamed when you specify a value for it.

    The snippet editor does not check the syntax of the snippets that you edit
    or add. However, when you use the snippets, the code editor marks any
    errors by underlining them in red.

    To discard the changes you made to a built-in snippet, select \gui {Revert
    Built-in}.

    \section3 Removing Snippets

    Several similar built-in snippets might be provided for different use
    cases. To make the list of suggestions shorter when you write code, remove
    the built-in snippets that you do not need. If you need them later, you
    can restore them.

    To remove snippets, select a snippet in the list, and then select
    \gui Remove. To restore the removed snippets, select \gui {Restore Removed
    Built-ins}.

    \section3 Resetting Snippets

    To remove all added snippets and to restore all removed snippets, select
    \gui {Reset All}.

    \note If you now select \gui OK or \gui Apply, you permanently lose all
    your own snippets.

    \title Pasting and Fetching Code Snippets

    In \QC, you can paste snippets of code to a server or fetch snippets of code
    from the server. To paste and fetch snippets of code, \QC uses the
    following:

    \list

        \li \gui{CodePaster}

        \li \gui{Pastebin.Com}

        \li \gui{Pastebin.Ca}

        \li \gui{Paste.KDE.Org}

        \li \gui{Shared network drives}

    \endlist

    To configure the server, select \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} >
    \gui{Code Pasting} > \gui CodePaster. In the \gui Server field, specify the
    host name of the CodePaster service.

    Select \gui Fileshare to specify the path to a shared
    network drive. The code snippets are copied to the drive as simple files.
    You have to delete obsolete files from the drive manually.

    To paste a snippet of code onto the server, select \gui{Tools} >
    \gui{Code Pasting} > \gui{Paste Snippet} or press \key{Alt+C,Alt+P}.
    By default, \QC copies the URL of the snippet to the clipboard and displays
    the URL in the \gui Output pane.

    To fetch a snippet of code from the server, select \gui{Tools} >
    \gui{Code Pasting} > \gui{Fetch Snippet} or press \key{Alt+C,Alt+F}.

    To fetch content from a URL on a CodePaster service, select \gui{Tools} >
    \gui{Code Pasting} > \gui{Fetch from URL}. The content is opened in the code
    editor.

    \note To use \gui{Pastebin.Com}, configure the domain
    prefix in \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} > \gui{Code Pasting} >
    \gui{Pastebin.com}.

    For example, you might ask colleagues to review a change that you plan to
    submit to a version control system. If you use the Git version control
    system, you can create a \e{diff} view by selecting \gui{Tools > Git >
    Diff Repository}. You can then upload its contents to the server by choosing
    \gui{Tools} > \gui{Code Pasting} > \gui{Paste Snippet}. The reviewers can
    retrieve the code snippet by selecting \gui{Tools > Code Pasting >
    Fetch Snippet}. If they have the project currently opened in \QC, they can
    apply and test the change by choosing \gui{Tools > Git > Apply Patch}.

    \title Using FakeVim Mode

    In the \gui{FakeVim} mode, you can run the main editor in a manner similar
    to the Vim editor. To run the editor in the \gui{FakeVim} mode, select
    \gui{Edit} > \gui{Advanced} > \gui{Use Vim-style Editing} or press
    \key{Alt+V,Alt+V}.

    In the \gui{FakeVim} mode, most keystrokes in the main editor will be
    intercepted and interpreted in a way that resembles Vim. Documentation for
    Vim is not included in \QC. For more information on using Vim,
    see \l{http://www.vim.org/docs.php}{Documentation} on the Vim web site.

    To map commands entered on the \gui{FakeVim} command line to actions of the
    \QC core, select \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} > \gui{FakeVim} >
    \gui{Ex Command Mapping}.

    To map \e {user commands} to keyboard shortcuts, select \gui{Tools > Options
    > FakeVim > User Command Mapping}. The user command mapped to the shortcut
    is executed by FakeVim as if you were typing it (as when replaying a macro).

    To make changes to the Vim-style settings, select \gui{Tools} >
    \gui{Options} > \gui FakeVim > \gui{General}.

    \image qtcreator-fakevim-options.png "FakeVim options"

    To preselect the indentation settings specified for the text editor, select
    \gui {Copy Text Editor Settings}. To preselect the Qt coding style, select
    \gui {Set Qt Style}. To preselect a simple indentation style, select
    \gui {Set Plain Style}. You can then change any of the preselected settings.

    To use a Vim-style color scheme, select \gui {Tools > Options >
    Text Editor > Fonts & Color}. In the \gui {Color Scheme} list, select
    \gui {Vim (dark)}.

    To quit the FakeVim mode, unselect \gui{Tools} > \gui{Options} >
    \gui{FakeVim} > \gui {Use FakeVim} or press \key{Alt+V,Alt+V}.

    You can temporarily escape FakeVim mode to access the normal \QC
    keyboard shortcuts like \key{Ctrl-R} for \gui{Run} by pressing
    \key{,} first.

    You can specify tab policy and tab size in the \gui Typing group. In the
    \gui {Tab policy} field, select whether to use only spaces or only tabs for
    indentation, or to use a mixture of them.

    By default, the tab length in code editor is 8 spaces and the indent size is
    4 spaces. You can specify the tab length and indent size separately for each
    project and for different types of files.

    You can have continuation lines aligned with the previous line. In the
    \gui {Align continuation lines} field, select \gui {Not at all} to disable
    automatic alignment and indent continuation lines to the logical depth.
    To always use spaces for alignment, select \gui {With Spaces}. To follow the
    \gui {Tab policy}, select \gui {With Regular Indent}.

    \section2 Speficying Typing Options

    When you type text or code, it is indented automatically according to the selected
    text editor or code style options. Specify typing options in the
    \gui Typing group. To disable automatic indentation, deselect the
    \gui {Enable automatic indentation} check box.

    You can specify how the indentation is decreased when you press
    \gui Backspace in the \gui {Backspace indentation} field. To go back one
    space at a time, select \gui None. To decrease indentation in leading white
    space by one level, select \gui {Follows Previous Indents}. To move back one
    tab length if the character to the left of the cursor is a space, select
    \gui Unindents.

    You can specify whether the \key Tab key automatically indents text when you
    press it. To automatically indent text, select \gui Always in the
    \gui {Tab key performs auto-indent} field. To only indent text when the
    cursor is located within leading white space, select \gui {In Leading White
    Space}.

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Content

    You can indent public, protected, and private statements and declarations
    related to them within classes.

    You can also indent statements within methods and blocks and declarations
    within namespaces.

    \image qtcreator-code-style-content.png "Content options"

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Braces

    You can indent class, namespace, enum and method declarations and code
    blocks.

    \image qtcreator-code-style-braces.png "Braces options"

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Switch Statements

    You can indent case or default statements, or statements or blocks related
    to them within switch statements.

    \image qtcreator-code-style-switch.png "Switch options"

    \section1 Specifying Alignment

    To align continuation lines to tokens after assignments, such as = or
    +=, select the \gui {Align after assignments} check box. You can specify
    additional settings for aligning continuation lines in the \gui General
    tab.

    \title Finding and Replacing

    To search through the currently open file:

    \list 1

        \li Press \key Ctrl+F or select \gui Edit > \gui Find/Replace >
            \gui{Find/Replace}.

        \li Enter the text you are looking for.

            If the text is found, all occurrences are highlighted as you type.

        \li To go to the next occurrence, click \inlineimage qtcreator-next.png
            (\gui {Find Next}), or press \key F3. To go to the previous
            occurrence click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-previous.png
            (\gui {Find Previous}), or press \key Shift+F3.

    \endlist

    You can restrict the search in the \gui Find field by selecting one
    or several search criteria:

    \list

        \li To make your search case sensitive, select
            \gui {Case Sensitive}.

        \li To search only whole words, select
            \gui {Whole Words Only}.

        \li To search using regular expressions, select
            \gui {Regular Expressions}.
            Regular expressions used in \QC are modeled on Perl regular
            expressions. For more information on using regular expressions, see
            \l{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qregexp.html#details}
            {Detailed Description} in the QRegExp Class Reference.

    \endlist

    \note If you have selected text before selecting \gui {Find/Replace}, the
    search is conducted within the selection.

    To replace occurrences of the existing text, enter the new text in the
    \gui{Replace with} field.

    \list

        \li To replace the selected occurrence and move to the next one,
            click \gui {Find Next}
            or press \key Ctrl+=.

        \li To replace the selected occurrence and move to the previous one,
            click \gui {Find Previous}
            .

        \li To replace all occurrences in the file, click \gui{Replace All}.

    \endlist

    The \gui{Preserve Case when Replacing} option can be selected to preserve
    the case of the original text when replacing. This option is not compatible
    with the \gui {Regular Expressions} search option, and will thus be
    disabled when regular expressions are used. When the option is used, the
    case of the occurrence will be conserved, according to the following rules:

    \list

        \li  All upper-case occurrences are replaced with the upper-case new text.

        \li  All lower-case occurrences are replaced with the lower-case new text.

        \li  Capitalized occurrences are replaced with the capitalized new text.

        \li  Other occurrences are replaced with the new text as entered.

        \li  If an occurrence and the new text have the same prefix or suffix,
           then the case of the prefix and/or suffix are preserved, and the
           other rules are applied on the rest of the occurrence only.

    \endlist

    \section1 Advanced Search

    To search through projects, files on a file system or currently open files:

    \list 1

        \li Press \key Ctrl+Shift+F or select \gui Edit > \gui Find/Replace >
            \gui{Advanced Find} > \gui{Open Advanced Find}.

        \li Select the scope of your search:

            \list

                \li \gui{All Projects} searches files matching the defined file
                    pattern in all currently open projects.

                    For example, to search for \tt previewer only in \tt .cpp
                    and \tt .h files, enter in \gui{File pattern}
                    \tt *.cpp,*.h.

                    \image qtcreator-search-allprojects.png

                \li \gui{Current Project} searches files matching the defined
                    file pattern only in the project you are currently editing.

                \li \gui{Files on File System} recursively searches files
                    matching the defined file pattern in the selected directory.

                \li \gui{Current File} searches only the current file.

                \li \gui {Open Documents} searches all open files.

            \endlist

        \li Enter the text you are looking for and click \gui Search.

            \image qtcreator-searchresults.png

             A list of files containing the searched text is displayed in the
            \gui{Search Results} pane.

            \list

                \li To see all occurrences in a file, double-click the file name
                    in the list.

                \li To go to an occurrence, double-click it.

                \li To repeat the search after you have made changes to the
                    listed files, for example, select \gui {Search Again}.

            \endlist

    \endlist

    The search results are stored in the search history from which you can
    select earlier searches.

    \note You can use \gui{Advanced Find} also to search for symbols. For more
    information, see \l{Finding Symbols}.

    {QML component} in your Qt C++ or Qt Quick project:

    \list 1

        \li In the editor, place the cursor on the symbol or component, and
            select:

        \list

            \li \gui {Tools > C++ > Find Usages}

            \li \gui {Tools > QML/JS > Find Usages}

            \li \key Ctrl+Shift+U

        \endlist

        \QC  looks for the symbol in the following locations:

        \list

            \li Files listed as a part of the project

            \li Files directly used by the project files (for example, generated
                files)

            \li Header files of used frameworks and libraries

        \endlist

        \note You can also select \gui{Edit > Find/Replace > Advanced Find >
        C++ Symbols} to search for classes, methods, enums, and declarations
        either from files listed as part of the project or from all files that
        are used by the code, such as include files.

        \image qtcreator-search-cpp-symbols.png

        \li The \gui{Search Results} pane opens and shows the location and
            number of instances of the symbol in the current project.

            \image qtcreator-refactoring-find.png

    \endlist

    You can browse the search results in the following ways:

    \list

        \li To go directly to an instance, double-click the instance in the
            \gui{Search Results} pane.

        \li To move between instances, click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-forward.png
            and
            \inlineimage qtcreator-back.png
            in the \gui{Search Results} pane.

        \li To expand and collapse the list of all instances, click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-expand.png
            .

        \li To clear the search results, click \inlineimage qtcreator-clear.png
            .

    \endlist

    \section1 Renaming Symbols

    To rename a specific symbol in a Qt project:

    \list 1

        \li In the editor, place the cursor on the symbol you would like to
            change and select \gui Tools > \gui C++ >
            \gui{Rename Symbol Under Cursor} or \gui Tools > \gui QML/JS >
            \gui{Rename Symbol Under Cursor}. Alternatively, press
            \key Ctrl+Shift+R.

            The \gui{Search Results} pane opens and shows the location and
            number of instances of the symbol in the current project.

            \image qtcreator-refactoring-replace.png

        \li To replace all selected instances, enter the name of the new symbol
            in the \gui{Replace with} text box and click \gui Replace.

            To omit an instance, uncheck the check-box next to the instance.

            \note This action replaces all selected instances of the symbol in
            all files listed in the \gui{Search Results} pane. You cannot
            undo this action.

    \endlist

    \note Renaming local symbols does not open the \gui{Search Results} pane.
    The instances of the symbol are highlighted in code and you can edit the
    symbol. All instances of the local symbol are changed as you type.

    \section1 Applying Refactoring Actions

    \QC allows you to quickly and conveniently apply actions to refactor
    your code by selecting them in a context menu. The actions available depend
    on the position of the cursor in the code editor and on whether you are
    writing C++ or QML code.

    To apply refactoring actions to C++ code, right-click an operand,
    conditional statement, string, or name to open a context menu. In QML code,
    click an item ID or name.

    In the context menu, select \gui {Refactoring} and then select a refactoring
    action.

    You can also press \gui {Alt+Enter} to open a context menu that contains
    refactoring actions available in the current cursor position.

   \section2 Refactoring C++ Code

   You can apply the following types of refactoring actions to C++ code:

   \list

        \li Change binary operands

        \li Simplify if and while conditions (for example, move declarations out
            of if conditions)

        \li Modify strings (for example, set the encoding for a string to
            Latin-1, mark strings translatable, and convert symbol names to
            camel case)

        \li Create variable declarations

        \li Create method declarations and definitions

   \endlist

    The following table summarizes the refactoring actions for C++ code. The
    action is available when the cursor is in the position described in the
    Activation column.

    \table
        \header
            \li  Refactoring Action

        \row
            \li  Move Declaration out of Condition
            \li  Moves a declaration out of an if or while condition to simplify the
            condition. For example, rewrites

    \code
    if (Type name = foo()) {}
    \endcode

    \li    \code
    a op b
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    !(a invop b)
    \endcode

    \li    \code
    (a op b)
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    !(a invop b)
    \endcode

    \li   \code
    !(a op b)
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    (a invob b)
    \endcode

    \endlist

            \li  <= < > >= == !=
        \row
            \li  Split Declaration
            \li  Splits a simple declaration into several declarations. For example,

    as

    \code
    int *a;
    int b;
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    if (something) {
       if (something_else) {
       }
    }
    \endcode

    and

    \code
    if (something || something_else)
        x;
    \endcode

    with

    \code
    if (something)
        x;
    else if (something_else)
        x;
    \endcode

            \li  && ||
        \row
            \li  Swap Operands
            \li  Rewrites an expression in the inverse order using the inverse operator.
            For example, rewrites:
    \code
    a op b
    \endcode

    as
    \code

            \li  Convert to Objective-C String Literal
            \li  Converts a string literal to an Objective-C string literal
            if the file type is Objective-C(++). For example, rewrites the following strings

    \code
    "abcd"
    QLatin1String("abcd")
    QLatin1Literal("abcd")
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    @"abcd"
    \endcode
            \li  String literal
        \row
            \li  Enclose in QLatin1Char()
            \li  Sets the encoding for a character to Latin-1, unless the character is
            already enclosed in QLatin1Char, QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP, tr, trUtf8,
            QLatin1Literal, or QLatin1String. For example, rewrites

    \code
    'a'
    \endcode

    as

    \code

    QLatin1String("abcd")
    \endcode

            \li  String literal

        \row
            \li  Mark as Translatable
            \li  Marks a string translatable. For example, rewrites \c "abcd" with
            one of the following options, depending on which of them is available:

    \code
    tr("abcd")
    QCoreApplication::translate("CONTEXT", "abcd")
    QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP("GLOBAL", "abcd")
    \endcode

            \li  String literal

        \row
            \li  #include Header File
            \li  Adds the matching #include statement for a forward-declared class or struct
            \li  Forward-declared class or struct
        \row
            \li  Add Definition in ...
            \li  Inserts a definition stub for a function declaration either in the header file
            (inside or outside the class) or in the implementation file. For free functions, inserts
            the definition after the declaration of the function or in the implementation file.
            Qualified names are minimized when possible, instead of always being fully expanded.
            For example, rewrites

    \code
    Class Foo {
        void bar();
    };
    \endcode

    as (inside class)

    \code
    Class Foo {

    };
    \endcode

    as (outside class)

    \code
    Class Foo {
        void bar();
    };

    void Foo::bar()
    {

    }
    \endcode

    as (in implementation file)

    \code
    // Header file
    Class Foo {
        void bar();
    };

    // Implementation file

            \li  Add 'Function' Declaration
            \li  Inserts the member function declaration that matches the member function
            definition into the class declaration. The function can be public,
            protected, private, public slot, protected slot, or private slot.
            \li  Method name
        \row
            \li  Switch with Next/Previous Parameter
            \li  Moves a parameter down or up one position in a parameter list.
            \li  Parameter in the declaration or definition of a function or method
        \row
            \li  Extract Method
            \li  Moves the selected code to a new method and replaces the block of
            code with a call to the new method. Enter a name for the method in
            the \gui {Extract Function Refactoring} dialog.
            \li  Block of code selected

            is known. For example, rewrites

    \code
    a = foo();
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    Type a = foo();
    \endcode

    where Type is the return type of \c {foo()}

            \li  Assignee

        \row
            \li  Convert to Camel Case
            \li  Converts a symbol name to camel case, where elements of the name are joined
            without delimiter characters and the initial character of each element is
            capitalized. For example, rewrites \c an_example_symbol
            as \c anExampleSymbol and \c AN_EXAMPLE_SYMBOL as \c AnExampleSymbol
            \li  Identifier
        \row

        \row
            \li  Generate Missing Q_PROPERTY Members
            \li  Adds missing members to a Q_PROPERTY:
            \list
                \li  \c read method
                \li  \c write method, if there is a WRITE

                \li  data member with the name \c {m_<propertyName>}
            \endlist
            \li  Q_PROPERTY
        \row
            \li Apply Changes
            \li Keeps function declarations and definitions synchronized by
                checking for the matching declaration or definition when you
                edit a function signature and by applying the changes to the
                matching code.
            \li Function signature. When this action is available, a light bulb
                icon appears:
                \inlineimage qml-toolbar-indicator.png
        \row
            \li Add #include for undeclared identifier
            \li Adds an #include directive to the current file to make the
                declaration of a symbol available.
            \li Undeclared identifier
        \row
            \li Reformat Pointers or References
            \li Reformats declarations with pointers or references according
            to the code style settings for the current project. In case no
            project is open, the current global code style settings are used.
            For example, rewrites:

    \code
    char*s;
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    char *s;
    \endcode

    When applied to selections, all suitable declarations in the selection are
    rewritten.

            \li  Member variable in class definition
        \row
            \li Move Function Definition
            \li Moves a function definition to the implementation file, outside the class or back to its declaration. For example, rewrites:

    \code
    class Foo
    {
      void bar()
      {
          // do stuff here
      }
    };
    \endcode

        \row
            \li Assign to Local Variable
            \li Adds a local variable which stores the return value of a function call or a new expression. For example, rewrites:

    \code
    QString s;
    s.loLatin1();
    \endcode
    as
    \code
    QString s;
    QByteArray latin1 = s.toLatin1();
    \endcode
    and
    \code

                \li Insert declarations and the corresponding definitions inside the class.
                \li Insert declarations and the corresponding definitions outside the class.
                \li Insert declarations and the corresponding definitions in the implementation file
                (only if an implementation file exists).
            \endlist
            \image qtcreator-refactoring-virtual-function-dialog.png

            \li Class or base class name

   \section2 Refactoring QML Code

   You can apply the following types of refactoring actions to QML code:

   \list

        \li  Rename IDs

        \li  Split initializers

        \li  Move a QML type into a separate file to reuse it in other
        .qml files

   \endlist

    The following table summarizes the refactoring actions for QML code. The
    action is available when the cursor is in the position described in the
    Activation column.

    \table
        \header
            \li  Refactoring Action
            \li  Description

        \row
            \li  Split Initializer
            \li  Reformats a one-line type into a multi-line type. For example,
            rewrites
    \code
    Item { x: 10; y: 20; width: 10 }
    \endcode

    as

    \code
    Item {
        x: 10;

        width: 10
    }
    \endcode
            \li  QML type property
        \row
            \li  Wrap in Loader
            \li  Wraps the type in a Component type and loads it dynamically in
               a Loader type. This is usually done to improve startup time.
            \li  QML type name
        \row
            \li  Add a message suppression comment
            \li  Prepends the line with an annotation comment that stops the message
               from being generated.
            \li  Error, warning or hint from static analysis

            The main.cpp file opens in the editor.

        \li To move to a line in the file, enter the line number in the locator.

    \endlist

    To move directly to a particular line in the document when you open the
    document, append a plus sign (+) or a colon (:) to the file name in the
    locator. For example, to open main.cpp to line 41, enter: \c {main.cpp:41}.

    If the path to a file is very long, it might not fit into the locator
    window. To view the full path, press \key Alt when the filename is selected.

    It is also possible to enter only a part of a search string. As you type,
    the locator shows the occurrences of that string regardless of where in the
    name of an component it appears.

    To narrow down the search results, you can use the following wildcard
    characters:

    \list

        \li To match any number of any or no characters, enter \b{*}.

        \li To match a single instance of any character, enter \b{?}.

    \endlist

    \section1 Using Locator Filters

    The locator enables you to browse not only files, but any items defined by
    \b{locator filters}. By default, the locator contains filters for:

    \list

        \li Locating any open document

        \li Locating files anywhere on your file system

        \li Locating files belonging to your project, such as source, header
            resource, and .ui files

        \li Locating class and method definitions in your project or anywhere
            referenced from your project

        \li Locating class and method definitions in the current document

        \li Locating a specific line and column in the document displayed in
            your editor

        \li Opening help topics, including Qt documentation

        \li Performing web searches

        \li Running text editing macros that you record and save. For more
            information, see \l{Using Text Editing Macros}

        \li Executing shell commands

        \li Executing version control system commands. For more information, see
            \l{Using Version Control Systems}

    \endlist

    To use a specific locator filter, type the assigned prefix followed by
    \key Space. The prefix is usually a single character. Then type the search
    string (typically, a filename or class name) or the command to execute.

    For example, to locate symbols matching QDataStream:

    \list 1

        \li Activate the locator.

        \li Enter \tt{\b{: QDataStream}} (: (colon) followed by a
            \key Space and the symbol name (QDataStream)).

            The locator lists the results.

            \image qtcreator-navigate-popup.png

    \endlist

    By default, the following filters are enabled and you do not need to use
    their prefixes explicitly:

    \list

        \li Going to a line and column in the current file (l).

        \li Going to an open file (o).

        \li Going to a file in any open project (a).

    \endlist

    \section1 Configuring Locator Filters

    If the default filters do not match your use case, you can check whether you
    can change them. For all filters, you can change the filter prefix and
    restrict the search to items that match the filter.

    To configure a locator filter:

    \list 1

        \li In the locator, click \inlineimage qtcreator-locator-magnify.png
            (\gui {Options}) and select \gui Configure to open the \gui Locator
            options.

        \li Select a filter, and then select \gui Edit.

        \li Specify the prefix string.

        \li To show only results matching this filter, select
            \gui{Limit to prefix}.

        \li Specify other available options. For more information, see
            \l{Adding Web Search Engines}.

    \endlist

    \section2 Adding Web Search Engines

    You can use the \gui {Web Search (\c r)} locator filter to perform
    web searches. URLs and search commands for Bing, Google, Yahoo! Search,
    cplusplus.com, and Wikipedia are configured by default.

    To find out the format of the search command to use for your favorite
    web search engine, perform a search in your browser and copy the resulting
    URL to the locator filter configuration. Replace the search term with the
    variable \c {%1}.

    To add URLs and search commands to the list:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {Tools > Options > Environment > Locator >
            Web Search (prefix: r) >
            Edit}.

        \li Select \gui Add to add a new entry to the list.

            \image qtcreator-add-online-doc.png "Filter Configuration dialog"

        \li Double-click the new entry to specify a URL and a search command.
            For example, http://www.google.com/search?q=%1.

        \li Click \gui OK.

    \endlist

    \section1 Creating Locator Filters

    To quickly access files not directly mentioned in your project, you can
    create your own locator filters. That way you can locate files in a
    directory structure you have defined.

    To create a locator filter:

    \list 1

        \li In the locator, select \gui {Options > Configure} to open the
            \gui Locator options.

            \image qtcreator-locator-customize.png

        \li Click \gui Add.

        \li In the \gui{Filter Configuration} dialog:

        \list

            \li Name your filter.

            \li Select at least one directory. The locator searches directories
                recursively.

            \li Define the file pattern as a comma separated list. For example,
                to search all .h and .cpp files, enter \b{*.h,*.cpp}

            \li Specify the prefix string.

                To show only results matching this filter, select
                \gui{Limit to prefix}.

                \image qtcreator-navigate-customfilter.png

        \endlist

        \li  Click OK.

    \endlist

    \section1 Configuring Locator Cache

    The locator searches the files matching your file pattern in the
    directories you have selected and caches that information. The cache for
    all default filters is updated as you write your code. By default,
    \QC updates the filters created by you once an hour.

    To update the cached information manually, select \gui {Options > Refresh}
    in the locator.

    To set a new cache update time:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {Tools > Options > Environment > Locator}.

        \li In \gui{Refresh interval}, define new time in minutes.

    \endlist
