    \title Using External Tools

    You can use external tools directly from \QC. Qt Linguist,
    QML preview tools, the
    default text editor for your system, and the \c sort tool are preconfigured
    for use. You can change their default configurations and configure new
    tools.

    \section1 Using Qt Linguist

    You can use the Qt Linguist release manager tools, lupdate and lrelease,
    directly from \QC. The lupdate tool is used to synchronize source
    code and translations. The lrelease tool is used to create run-time
    translation files for use by the released application.

    To synchronize ts files from a translator with the application code,
    select \gui {Tools > External > Text > Linguist > Update Translations
    (lupdate)}.

    To generate from the ts files qm translation files that can be used by an
    application, select \gui {Tools > External > Text > Linguist > Release
    Translations (lrelease)}.

    By default, the project .pro file is passed to the tools as an argument. To
    specify other command line arguments for the tools, select \gui {Tools >
    External > Configure}.

    For more information about Qt Linguist, see
    \l{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtlinguist/qtlinguist-index.html}
    {Qt Linguist Manual}.

    \section1 Previewing QML Files

    You can preview the current QML document in the QML Viewer (Qt Quick 1) or
    QML Scene (Qt Quick 2). The preview tools enable you to load QML documents
    for viewing and testing while you are developing an application.

    To preview the currently active QML file, select \gui Tools > \gui External
    > \gui {Qt Quick} > \gui {Preview (qmlviewer)} or \gui {Preview (qmlscene)}.

    \section1 Using External Text Editors

    You can open files for editing in the default text editor for your system:
    Notepad on Windows and vi on Linux and Mac OS.
    To open the file you are currently viewing in an external editor, select
    \gui Tools > \gui External > \gui Text > \gui {Edit with Notepad} or
    \gui {Edit with vi}, depending on your system.

    \QC looks for the editor path in the PATH environment variable
    of your operating system.

    \section1 Sorting Text Alphabetically

    To sort selected text alphabetically, select \gui {Tools > External > Text
    > Sort Selection}. The \c sort tool takes the selected text as input and
    returns it in alphabetic order. By default, the output replaces the
    original selection in the code editor.

    To change the default configuration, select \gui {Tools > External >
    Configure}.

    \section1 Configuring External Tools

    You can change the configuration of preconfigured tools and configure
    additional tools in \QC \gui Options.

    You can use \QC variables in the fields that you can select from
    lists of available \QC variables (1).

    To configure external tools:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {Tools > External > Configure}.

        \li Select \gui {Add > Add Tool}
            to add a new tool. You can also select \gui {Add Category} to add a
            new category.

        \li In the \gui Executable field, specify the executable to run. If the
            executable is found in your system PATH variable, do not specify
            the path to it.

        \li In the \gui Arguments field, specify optional arguments for running
            the executable.

        \li In the \gui {Working directory} field, specify the path to the
            working directory.

        \li In the \gui {Output pane}, select how to handle output from the
            tool. You can ignore the output, view it in the \gui {General
            Messages} output pane, or replace the selected text with the
            output in the code editor.

        \li In the \gui {Error output pane}, select how to handle error messages
            from the tool.

        \li In the \gui Input field, specify text that is passed as standard
            input to the tool.

    \endlist

    The category and tool are added to the \gui {Tools > External} menu.

    If you change the configuration of preconfigured tools, you can later
    revert the changes by selecting the \gui Revert button.

    The tool configurations that you add and modify are stored in XML format in
    the user configuration folder. For example,
    \c {~/config/QtProject/qtcreator/externaltools}
    on Linux and Mac OS and
    \c {C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QtProject\qtcreator\externaltools}
    in Windows. To share a configuration with other users, copy an XML
    configuration file to the folder.
