    \title Connecting Mobile Devices

    You can connect mobile devices to the development PC to build, run, debug,
    and analyze applications on them from \QC. When you install an SDK for a
    target platform, such as Android or QNX, the build and run settings for the
    development targets delivered with the SDK might be set up automatically in
    \QC.

    You can connect the device to the development PC using a USB connection.
    Additionally, you can connect Linux-based devices by using a WLAN
    connection.

    \list

        \li \l{Connecting Android Devices}

            Qt applications for Android are compiled as \c {shared objects} that
            are loaded by a Java launcher generated by the Qt for Android SDK.
            This is totally transparent to users. As Qt is composed of libraries
            referencing each other, Qt 4 applications are only supported on
            Android version 1.6, or later, and Qt 5 applications on version
            2.3.3, or later. You must install the Qt for Android SDK to develop
            for Android devices.

        \li \l{Connecting BlackBerry 10 Devices}

            \QC enables you to develop, deploy and debug your Qt applications
            to BlackBerry 10.
            You need to install the BlackBerry 10 NDK which contains a pre-built Qt.
            You also need either a BlackBerry 10 device or the simulator.

        \li \l{Connecting Embedded Linux Devices}

            If you have a tool chain for building applications for embedded
            Linux devices (with no MADDE support) installed on the development
            PC, you can add it and the device to \QC.

        \li \l{Connecting Maemo Devices}

            Maemo 5 (Fremantle) is a Linux-based software platform developed by
            Nokia and delivered on the Nokia N900. Use a connectivity tool (Mad
            Developer) to create the device-side end point for USB and WLAN
            connections.

       \li \l{Connecting MeeGo Harmattan Devices}

            MeeGo Harmattan is a Linux-based software platform developed by
            Nokia and preinstalled on Nokia N950 and Nokia N9. It enables
            developers to create applications using the Qt framework.
            Use the SDK Connectivity tool that is preinstalled on the device to
            create the device-side end point for USB and WLAN connections.

        \li \l{Connecting QNX Devices}

            You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and
            debug applications on them from within \QC. This is currently only
            supported for BlackBerry Playbook and QNX Neutrino devices, and
            requires the BlackBerry NDK or the QNX SDK to be installed on the
            development PC.
