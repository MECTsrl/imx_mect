    \title Setting Up an Autotools Project
    The AutotoolsProjectManager is a plugin for autotools support. It is disabled by default.
    To enable the plugin, select \gui{Help > About Plugins > Build Systems > AutotoolsProjectManager}.
    To use the plugin, restart \QC.

    To work with your Autotools project in \QC:

        \list 1

            \li  Select \gui{File > Open File or Project}.
            \li  Select the Makefile.am file from your project. This is the only
               way you can use the autotools plugin.
            \li  Select the build directory. Only in-source building is currently
               supported.
            \li  Select \gui Finish.
               \QC displays the project tree structure. The root node displays
               the project name. All project files are listed below it and you
               can open them from the list.

               \image qtcreator-autotools-buildrun.png

            \li  Select \gui Run to build and run the application. The predefined
               build steps (autogen.sh or autoreconf, configure, and make) are
               executed.

               The first time you run the application you must choose the
               executable.

            \li  To check and edit autotools build steps, select
               \gui{Projects > Build Settings}.

               You can add parameters to the predefined autotools build steps.
