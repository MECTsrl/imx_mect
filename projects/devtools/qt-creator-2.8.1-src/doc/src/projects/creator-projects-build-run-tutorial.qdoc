    \title Building and Running an Example

    You can test that your \QSDK installation is successful by opening an existing
    example application project.

    \list 1

        \li In the \gui Welcome mode, select \gui Examples (1).

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-open.png "Selecting an example"

        \li Select an example in the list of examples. You can also search for
            examples (2).

            \note The project opens in the \gui Edit mode, and the documentation
            for the example hides these instructions. To return to these
            instructions, select \gui {Previous Page} on the toolbar or
            press \key {Alt+Left}.

        \li To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a
            device, click the \gui {Kit Selector} and select a
            \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for the
            device.

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-kit-selector.png "Selecting a kit to build with"

            If you installed \QC as part of a Qt installation, it should have
            automatically detected the installed kit. If no kits are available,
            see \l{Adding Kits}.

        \li Click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-run.png
            (\gui Run) to build and run the application.

        \li To see the compilation progress, press \key{Alt+4} to open the
            \gui {Compile Output} pane.

            If build errors occur, check that a \l{Adding Qt Versions}
            {Qt version} and \l{Adding Compilers}{compiler} are installed and
            configured and that the necessary kits are configured.

            The \gui Build progress bar on the toolbar turns green when the
            project is successfully built. The application opens on the device.
