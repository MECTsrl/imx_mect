    \title Building for Multiple Platforms

    You can build applications for multiple target platforms, or using different
    compilers,
    debuggers or Qt versions. \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{Kits} define the tools,
    device type and other settings to use.

    By default, when you run the application, you
    automatically build and deploy it first.
    However, you can also perform each operation separately.

    To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a device,
    you can build the project. The build errors and warnings are displayed in
    the \gui {Issues} output pane. More detailed information is displayed
    in the \gui {Compile Output} pane.

    To build an application:

    \list 1

        \li  Select a \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for the project.

        \image qtcreator-kit-selector.png "Kit selector"

        \li  Choose \gui {Build > Build Project} or press \key {Ctrl+B}.

    \endlist

    For more information on the options you have, see
    \l{Specifying Build Settings}.

    To quickly check the compile output for changes that you made in one file or
    subproject, you can use the \gui Build menu commands to build a file or
    subproject.
