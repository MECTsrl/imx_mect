    \title Adding Qt Versions

    \QC allows you to have multiple versions of Qt installed on your development
    PC and use different versions to build your projects.
    For example, Qt 4 SDK contains special Qt versions for developing applications
    for mobile devices.

    \QC automatically detects the Qt versions that are registered by
    your system or by \QSDK. To view detailed information for each Qt
    version, select it in the list and select \gui Details in the
    \gui {Qt version for} section. To add Qt versions, select
    \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions}.

    You specify the Qt version to use for each \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}
    {kit} for building and running your projects
    in \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui Kits.

    \section2 Setting Up New Qt Versions

    To add a Qt version:

        \list 1

            \li Select \gui {Tools > Options > Build & Run > Qt Versions > Add}.

                \image qtcreator-qt4-qtversions-add.png

            \li Select the directory where the qmake executable is located.

                \QC automatically determines the path to the binaries in
                the Qt installation and displays it in the \gui{qmake location}
                field.

            \li In the \gui{Version name} field, edit the name that \QC
                suggests for the Qt version.

            \li In the \gui Helpers section, you can build the debugging
                helpers that are available for the Qt version. This is
                necessary, because the internal data structures of Qt can
                change between versions. For more information, see
                \l{Using Debugging Helpers}.
