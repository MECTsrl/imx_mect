    \title Running on Multiple Platforms

    By default, running an application also builds it and deploys it to a
    location from where it can be run on the desktop, in \QS, or
    on a mobile device that is connected to the development PC.

    To run executable files without deploying them first, deselect the
    \gui {Tools > Options > Project > Always deploy project before running it}
    option.

    For more information on the options you have, see
    \l{Specifying Run Settings}.
