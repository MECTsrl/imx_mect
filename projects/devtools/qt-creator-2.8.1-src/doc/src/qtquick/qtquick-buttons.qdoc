    \title Creating Buttons

    To create a button component:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {File > New File or Project > Qt > QML File > Choose}
            to create a QML file called Button.qml (for example).

            \note Components are listed in the \gui Library pane only if the
            filename begins with a capital letter.

        \li Click \gui {Design} to edit the file in the visual editor.

        \li In the \gui Navigator pane, click \gui Rectangle to set properties
            for it.

        \li In the \gui Properties pane, modify the appearance of the button.

        \list a

            \li In the \gui Size field, set the width (\gui W) and height
                (\gui H) of the button.

            \li In the \gui Color field, select the button color.

            \li In the \gui Radius field, use the slider to set the radius of
                the rectangle and produce rounded corners for the button.

        \endlist

        \li Drag and drop a \gui {Text} item on top of the \gui Rectangle. This
            creates a nested item where \gui Rectangle is the parent item
            of \gui Text. Items are positioned relative to their parents.

        \li In the \gui Properties pane, edit the properties of the \gui Text
            item.

        \list a

            \li In the \gui Text field, type \b Button.

                You can select the text color in the \gui Color section and the
                font, size, and style in the
                \gui Font section.

            \li In the \gui Alignment field, select the center buttons to align
                the text to the center of the button.

            \li Click \gui {Layout}, and then click the
                \inlineimage qmldesigner-anchor-fill-screen.png
                (\gui {Fill to Parent}) button to anchor the text to the whole
                button area.

        \endlist

        \li Press \key {Ctrl+S} to save the button.

            \image qmldesigner-button.png "Button component"

    \endlist

    To create a graphical button that scales beautifully without using vector
    graphics, use the \l{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qml-qtquick2-borderimage.html}
    {Border Image} type. For more information, see
    \l{Creating Scalable Buttons and Borders}.

    \title Creating Scalable Buttons and Borders

    You can use the
    \l{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qml-qtquick2-borderimage.html}
    {Border Image} type to display an image, such as a PNG file, as a border
    and a background.

    Use two Border Image items and suitable graphics to make it look like the
    button is pushed down when it is clicked. One of the Border Image items
    is visible by default. You can specify that it is hidden and the other one
    becomes visible when the mouse is clicked.

    Add a Mouse Area that covers the whole area and emits the clicked signal
    (\c {parent.clicked()}) when it detects a mouse click.

    You can add text to the button and set it up as a property. The text can
    then be initialized from the outside, making the button a reusable UI
    component. The font size is also available in case the default size is too
    big. You can scale down the button text and use smooth text rendering for
    some extra quality.

    \image qmldesigner-borderimage.png "Graphical button"

    To create a graphical button:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui {File > New File or Project > Qt > QML File > Choose}
            to create a QML file called Button.qml (for example).

        \li Double-click the file to open it in the code editor.

        \li Replace the \gui Rectangle with an \gui Item, as illustrated by the
            following code snippet:

            \qml
            Item {

            }
            \endqml

        \li Specify properties and set expressions for the \gui Item, as
            illustrated by the following code snippet:

            \qml
            Item {
                property string text: ""
                property int fontSize: 10

                signal clicked

                width: 60
                height: 40
            }
            \endqml

            You will point to the properties and expression later.

        \li Click \gui {Design} to edit the file in the visual editor.

        \li Drag and drop two \gui {Border Image} items from the \gui Library pane
            to the scene.

        \li Drag and drop a \gui Text item to the scene.

        \li Drag and drop a \gui {Mouse Area} to the screen.

        \li In the \gui Navigator pane, select \gui border_image1 to specify
            settings for it in the \gui Properties pane:

        \list a

            \li Select \gui {Set Expression} in the menu next to the
                \gui Visibility check box.

            \li Enter the following expression to specify that the image is
                visible when the mouse is not pressed down:
                \c {!mouse_area1.pressed}.

            \li In the \gui Source field, select the image file for the button,
                for example button_up.png.

            \li  Click \gui {Layout}, and then click the
                \inlineimage qmldesigner-anchor-fill-screen.png
                (\gui {Fill to Parent}) button to anchor the border image to the
                \gui Item.

        \endlist

        \li Select \gui border_image2 to specify similar settings for it:

        \list a

            \li Set the following epression for \gui Visibility, to specify that
                the image is visible when the mouse is pressed down:
                \c {mouse_area1.pressed}.

            \li In the \gui Source field, select the image file for the button
                when it is clicked, for example button_down.png.

            \li Click \gui {Layout}, and then click the
                \gui {Fill to Parent}
                button to anchor the border image to the \gui Item.

        \endlist

        \li Select \gui text1 to specify font size and color, and text
            scaling and rendering:

        \list a

            \li In the \gui Color field, use the color picker to select
                the font color, or enter a value in the field.

            \li In the \gui Text field, select \gui {Set Expression} and
                enter a pointer to the \c {text} property that you specified
                earlier: \c {parent.txt}.

            \li Select the \gui Smooth check box to enable smooth text
                rendering.

            \li In the \gui Size field, select \gui {Pixels} to specify the font
                size in pixels. By default, the size is specified in points.

            \li In the \gui Size field, select \gui {Set Expression} and enter a
                pointer to the \c {fontSize} property that you specified
                earlier.

            \li Click \gui {Layout}, and then click the
                \inlineimage qmldesigner-center-in.png "Anchor buttons"
                (\gui {Set Vertical Anchor} and \gui {Set Horizontal Anchor})
                buttons to inherit the vertical and horizontal centering from
                the parent.

            \li Click \gui Advanced to specify scaling for the text in the
                \gui Scale field.

            \li Select \gui {Set Expression} and enter the following expression:
                \c {if (!mousearea1.pressed) { 1 } else { 0.95 }}.

                \note You can enter long and complicated expressions also in the
                code editor.

        \endlist

        \li In the code editor, add to the \c MouseArea a pointer to the
            \c clicked expression that you added earlier:
            \c {onClicked: parent.clicked()}.

    \endlist

    \note To test the button, add it to a Qt Quick Application or Qt
    Quick UI project and run the application.
