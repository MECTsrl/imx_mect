    \title Developing Widget Based Applications

    \QC automatically opens all .ui files in the integrated \QD, in \gui Design
    mode.

    \image qtcreator-formedit.png

    For more information about \QD, see the
    \l{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtdesigner/qtdesigner-manual.html}{Qt Designer Manual}.

    Generally, the integrated \QD contains the same functions as the standalone
    \QD. The following sections describe the differences.

    \section1 Code Editor Integration

    To switch between forms (\gui Design mode) and code (\gui Edit mode),
    press \key Shift+F4.

    You can use \QC to create stub implementations of slot functions. In the
    \gui Design mode, right-click a widget to open a context menu, and then
    select \gui {Go to Slot}. Select a signal in the list to go to an existing
    slot function or to create a new slot function.

    \section1 Managing Image Resources

    In standalone \QD, image resources are created using the built-in
    \gui {Resource Editor}. In \QC, .ui files are usually part of a project,
    which may contain several resource files (.qrc). They are created and
    maintained by using the \QC Resource Editor. The \QD \gui {Resource Editor}
    is de-activated and the image resources are displayed in the \QD
    \gui {Resource Browser}.

    \section1 Specifying Settings for Qt Designer

    To change the layout of \QD user interface elements:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui{Form Editor} > \gui Views > \gui Locked.

            When this option is not checked, you can change the layout.

        \li Click the header of an element and drag the element to a new
            position.

    \endlist

    To specify settings for \QD:

    \list

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Designer.

        \li Specify settins for generating classes and code in \gui {Class
            Generation}.

        \li Specify embedded device profiles, that determine style, font, and
            screen resolution, for example, in \gui{Embedded Design}.

        \li Specify settings for the grid and previewing forms in \gui Forms.

        \li Specify an additional folder for saving templates in \gui{Template
            Paths}.

    \endlist

    To preview the settings, select \gui Tools > \gui{Form Editor} >
    \gui Preview, or press \key Alt+Shift+R.

    \section1 Previewing Forms Using Device Skins

    A \e {device skin} is a set of configuration files that describe a mobile
    device. It includes a border image that surrounds the form and depicts a
    mobile device with its buttons.

    To preview your form using device skins:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Designer.

        \li Select the \gui{Print/Preview Configuration} check box.

        \li In the \gui {Device skin} field, select a device skin.

        \li When the form is open in \gui Design mode, press \key Alt+Shift+R.

        \li To end the preview, right-click the skin and select \gui Close in
            the context menu.

    \endlist
