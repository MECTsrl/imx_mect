  \class Core::IOptionsPage
  \mainclass
  \brief The IOptionsPage class is an interface for providing pages for the
  \gui Options dialog (called \gui Preferences on Mac OS).

  You need to subclass this interface and put an instance of your subclass
  into the plugin manager object pool (e.g. ExtensionSystem::PluginManager::addObject).
  Guidelines for implementing:
  \list
  \li id() is a unique identifier for referencing this page
  \li displayName() is the (translated) name for display
  \li category() is the unique id for the category that the page should be displayed in
  \li displayCategory() is the translated name of the category
  \li createPage() is called to retrieve the widget to show in the preferences dialog
     The widget will be destroyed by the widget hierarchy when the dialog closes
  \li apply() is called to store the settings. It should detect if any changes have been
         made and store those
  \li finish() is called directly before the preferences dialog closes
  \li matches() is used for the options dialog search filter
  \endlist
