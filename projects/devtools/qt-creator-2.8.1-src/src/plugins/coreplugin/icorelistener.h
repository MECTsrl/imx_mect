  \class Core::ICoreListener

  \brief The ICoreListener class provides a hook for plugins to veto on certain
  events emitted from the core plugin.

  You implement this interface if you want to prevent certain events from
  occurring, e.g.  if you want to prevent the closing of the whole application
  or to prevent the closing of an editor window under certain conditions.

  If e.g. the application window requests a close, then first
  ICoreListener::coreAboutToClose() is called (in arbitrary order) on all
  registered objects implementing this interface. If one if these calls returns
  false, the process is aborted and the event is ignored.  If all calls return
  true, the corresponding signal is emitted and the event is accepted/performed.

  Guidelines for implementing:
  \list
  \li Return false from the implemented method if you want to prevent the event.
  \li You need to add your implementing object to the plugin managers objects:
     ExtensionSystem::PluginManager::instance()->addObject(yourImplementingObject);
  \li Don't forget to remove the object again at deconstruction (e.g. in the destructor of
     your plugin).
