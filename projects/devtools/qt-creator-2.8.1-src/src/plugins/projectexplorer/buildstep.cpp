    \class ProjectExplorer::BuildStep

    \brief The BuildStep class provides build steps for projects.

    Build steps are the primary way plugin developers can customize
    how their projects (or projects from other plugins) are built.

    Projects are built by taking the list of build steps
    from the project and calling first \c init() and then \c run() on them.

    To change the way your project is built, reimplement
    this class and add your build step to the build step list of the project.

    \note The projects own the build step. Do not delete them yourself.

    \c init() is called in the GUI thread and can be used to query the
    project for any information you need.

    \c run() is run via QtConcurrent in a separate thread. If you need an
    event loop, you need to create it yourself.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::init()

    This function is run in the gui thread,
    use it to retrieve any information that you need in run()
*/

/*!
    \fn void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::run(QFutureInterface<bool> &fi)

    Reimplement this. This function is called when the target is build.
    By default this function is NOT run in the gui thread. It runs in its
    own thread. If you need an event loop, you need to create one.
    This function should block until the task is done

    The absolute minimal implementation is:
    \code
    fi.reportResult(true);
    \endcode

    By returning true from \sa runInGuiThread() this function is called in the
    gui thread. Then the function should not block and instead the
    finished() signal should be emitted.
*/

/*!
    \fn BuildStepConfigWidget *ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::createConfigWidget()

    Returns the Widget shown in the target settings dialog for this buildStep;
    ownership is transferred to the caller.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::immutable() const

    If this function returns true, the user can't delete this BuildStep for this target
    and the user is prevented from changing the order immutable steps are run
    the default implementation returns false.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::addTask(const ProjectExplorer::Task &task)
    \brief Add a task.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void addOutput(const QString &string, ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::OutputFormat format,
              ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::OutputNewlineSetting newlineSetting)

    The string is added to the generated output, usually in the output window.
    It should be in plain text, with the format in the parameter.
*/

/*!
    \fn void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::cancel() const

    This function needs to be reimplemented only for BuildSteps that return false from \sa runInGuiThread.
*/

/*!
    \fn  void ProjectExplorer::BuildStep::finished()
    \brief This signal needs to be emitted if the BuildStep runs in the gui thread.
