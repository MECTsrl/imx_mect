-- arch/sh/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

For the SH4 (SuperH 32bit) architecture, I-pipe patches are currently
based on STMicroelectronics 'STLinux' kernel releases [2].

Tested boards:

- STMicro MB442

This directory only contains the most recent patches used to validate
this Xenomai release on SH4 platforms; you may find the complete
collection of Adeos/I-pipe patches at the following location (see
