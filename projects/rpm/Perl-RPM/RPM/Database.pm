#   Description:    The RPM::Database class provides access to the RPM database
#                   as a tied hash, whose keys are taken as the names of
#                   packages installed and whose values are RPM::Header
#                   objects.
#
#   Functions:      new

#   Libraries:      RPM
#                   RPM::Header
#
#   Global Consts:  None.
#
#   Environment:    Just stuff from the RPM config.

=head1 NAME

RPM::Database - Access to the RPM database of installed packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RPM::Database;

    tie %RPM, "RPM::Database" or die "$RPM::err";

    for (sort keys %RPM)
    {
        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<RPM::Database> package provides access to the database of installed
packages on a system. The database may be accessed as either a tied hash
or as a blessed reference to a hash. The keys of the hash represent
packages on the system. The order in which they are returned by any of
C<keys>, C<each> or C<values>, is determined by the internal database
ordering. Unlike the keys in B<RPM::Header> (see L<RPM::Header>), the
keys here are in fact case-sensitive.

The return value corresponding to each key is a reference to a
B<RPM::Header> object. The header object is marked read-only, as the
RPM database is not directly modifiable via this interface.

There are also a number of class methods implemented, which are described in
the next section.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Creating an Object

An object may be created one of two ways:

    tie %D, "RPM::Database";

    $dataref = new RPM::Database;

The latter approach offers more direct access to the class methods, while
also permitting the usual tied-hash operations such as fetching:

    $dataref->{package}    # Such as "rpm" or "perl"

=head2 Class Methods

The following methods are available to objects of this class, in addition to
the tied-hash suite of operations. If the object is a hash instead of a
hash reference, it can be used to call these methods via:

    (tied %hash)->method_name(...)

=over

=item init

This causes a complete initialization of the RPM database. It must be run
with sufficient permissions to create/update the relevant files. It must
also be called as a static method, to avoid having any file descriptors
open on the database at the time.

=item rebuild

This rebuilds the database (same as "rpm --rebuilddb"). As with B<init>
above, this requires adequate permissions and must be invoked as a static
method.

=item find_by_file(file)

Returns a list of B<RPM::Header> objects that correspond to the package(s)
claiming ownership of the file "file".

=item find_by_group(group)

Returns of a list of headers for all packages flagged as being in the
group specified.

=item find_what_provides(provides)

Search as above, but based on which package(s) provide the functionality
specified as "provides".

=item find_what_requires(requires)

Return a list of headers for the packages that directly depend on the
specified package for installation and operation. The specified package should
be just the name, no version or release information.

=item find_what_conflicts(conflicts)

List those packages that have conflicts based on the value of "conflicts".

=item find_by_package(package)

This performs the search by a specific package name. This is the API call
used by the FETCH tied-hash method, but this differs in that if there is
in fact more than one matching record, all are returned.

=back

Any of the C<find_*> routines can take an B<RPM::Header> object as an argument,
in which case the package name will be retrieved and used for the argument. In
some cases (such as C<find_by_file>), this is probably not what you want. But
in other cases such as C<find_what_requires>, it may be exactly what you want.

=head2 Importable Defaults

Given that there may be only one concurrent process with the rpm database
open, and given that such would lead to a lot of program code starting with
the same sequence of use/tie or use/new, the following identifiers may be
imported from the package:

=over

=item %RPM

A hash pre-tied to the RPM::Database package (and thus the rpm database).

=item $RPM

A RPM::Database object, referencing a hash tied to the rpm database.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Direct binding to the internal error-management of B<rpm> is still under
development. At present, most operations generate their diagnostics to
STDERR.

=head1 CAVEATS

This is currently regarded as alpha-quality software. The interface is
subject to change in future releases.
