This list is maintained by Alex deVries <adevries@engsoc.carleton.ca>.

RPM itself is maintained by Erik Troan <ewt@redhat.com> and Marc Ewing
<marc@redhat.com>.  Discussion of RPM development happens on the mailing
list,
rpm-list@redhat.com.  See www.rpm.org for more details.

People listed are done by initials:
ewt  Erik Troan <ewt@redhat.com>

rg   Ralph Goers <Ralph_Goers@candle.com>

0. Bug fixes:
-------------

- cross building problems:
   - --sign doesn't work properly with multiple platforms
   - it rebuilds the source rpms, which is a problem


1. Stuff that are critical for future development:
--------------------------------------------------

- new macros for building, jbj

- fix RPM installation API to deal with sets of packages rather than
  individual packages, ewt

- have configure check for db_185.h (rg)

2. Features that are of definite interest 
-----------------------------------------

- getting rid of all the arch specific macros in lib/rpmrc.c

- An RPM repository, with a database to store packages of different
  versions and architectures.  This would facilite installation greatly,
  and allow for packages to have registered repositories. The intended 
  protocol is HTTP.  ewt, adv

- More flexible hardware and operating system tags, expanding the
  current Arch and OS tags to include flexible support for things
  like Arch version and OS version.  The intention is to build in 
  boolean operators.

- redo dependancy checking to take file conflicts into account

- make package ordering during upgrades more robust (ewt)

- PGP 5.0 support

- bzip2 compression

3. No-hurry features that would be considered
---------------------------------------------

- Fat RPM support, and a _seperate_ builder (partly done, adv)
