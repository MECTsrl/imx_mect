I would like to thank the following contributors to BeeCrypt:

- ARM Ltd, for donating a copy of the "ARM Architecture Reference Manual".
- Compaq, for their testdrive program, which gave me the opportunity to test many new platforms.
- SourceForge, for their excellent open source development platform, including their compile farm.
- Luca Filipozzi, for packaging BeeCrypt for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

And last but not least:

- Jon Sturgeon, bug hunter extraordinaire.
