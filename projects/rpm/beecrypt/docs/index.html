<H2>About BeeCrypt</H2>
<P>BeeCrypt is an open source cryptography library that contains highly
optimized C and assembler implementations of many well-known algorithms
including Blowfish, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal.
<P>The goal of the library is to offer a wide range of low-level cryptographic
primitives.
<P>BeeCrypt is licensed under the GNU Lesser Public General License (LGPL),
which means it can be used for free in both open and closed source commercial
products.
<BR>
<H2>About the documentation</H2>
<P>This is the first attempt to write a manual for the BeeCrypt Cryptography
Library. Eventually this will become a full-blown manual, with all the jingles
and bells.
