<H2>Installing the BeeCrypt Cryptography Library</H2>
<P>When it comes to installing BeeCrypt you basically have the following
alternatives:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><B>Installing from the source code - aka roll your own</B></LI>
<UL TYPE="disc">
<LI>Getting the source code</LI>
<P>The primary download location for the source tarball is through
<A HREF="http://www.virtualunlimited.com/download/index.html#beecrypt">
Virtual Unlimited's download page</A>. Alternatively you can download from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/beecrypt">SourceForge</A>.
<LI>Unpacking</LI>
<P>Once you have the source tarball, unpack it with <ACRONYM>GNU</ACRONYM>
tar (if you have it); on Windows you can use
<A HREF="http://www.rarsoft.com/">WinRAR</A>.
<LI>Configuring, building and installing</LI>
<P>The library can be built on a variety of platforms, and we will illustrate
the two most common ways:
<P><B>Using the <ACRONYM>GNU</ACRONYM> toolchain</B>
<P>The source tarball contains a configure script produced with
<ACRONYM>GNU</ACRONYM> autoconf;
on most platforms you will want to use this.
<P>As with most configure scripts, there are a few options you can use:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>--prefix</CODE></DT>
<DD>Use this option to indicate where you want the shared library and header
files installed. By default this is set to <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>. Another
suggested location is the <CODE>/usr</CODE> directory.</DD>
<DT><CODE>--target</CODE></DT>
<DD>Use this option to indicate that you want the library built for a
processor other than the one which is normally detected. Some examples of
useful combinations are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>--target=sparcv8plus-sun-solaris2.8</CODE></DT>
<DT><CODE>--target=i686-pc-freebsd4.3</CODE></DT>
</DL>
<DT><CODE>--enable-debug</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library with debug symbols, and without assembler
optimization, and instead just use plain C code.
<DT><CODE>--disable-optimized</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library without any processor-specific assembler
optimization, and instead just use plain C code.</DD>
<DT><CODE>--without-javaglue</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library without code which allows BeeCrypt for Java
to employ the native code in the library (automatic if you don't
have a JDK installed).</DD>
<DT><CODE>--disable-threads</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library without thread-safe code; useful on platforms
such as NetBSD (automatic if configure can't find threads).</DD>
<DT><CODE>--disable-aio</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library without asynchronous I/O on entropy devices
(automatic if configure can't find POSIX-compliant asynchronous I/O
routines).</DD>
<DT><CODE>--with-mtmalloc</CODE></DT>
<DD>will build the library with multi-thread optimized malloc routines
(available on Solaris 8). There is a tradeoff in speed versus the amount
of memory allocated.</DD>
</DL>
<P>To build, run: <XMP>make</XMP>
<P>To install, run: <XMP>make install</XMP>
</DL>
<P><B>Using Visual C++ for Win32</B>
<P>Microsoft Visual C++ is currently the preferred platform for compiling
the library, as it seems faster and more stable than other platforms.
<P>The prerequisites for compiling are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Visual C++ 6.0</DT>
<DD>At the time of writing, it is recommended to install the latest service
pack for Visual Studio. You can find it through Microsoft's
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads">download page</A>.</DD>
<DT>Visual C++ Processor Pack</DT>
<DD>You will need this package to support compilation of the assembler source 
code. You can download it
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/ppack/default.asp">
here</A>.</DD>
</DT>
<P>Before going on, make sure the following Visual C++ tools are found on
your PATH: cl.exe, (the compiler), ml.exe (the assembler), link.exe (the
linker) and nmake.exe (the make utility).
<P>For the Win32 platform, there is a Makefile.mak for Visual C++ included;
if you have a Pentium class processor, you won't have to configure the source
tree.
<P>This Makefile.mak is set up to compile Java support into the library. If
you don't have JDK 1.2 or later installed, you'll need to edit this file.
<P>To build, run: <XMP>nmake /f Makefile.mak</XMP>
<P><B>Using Metrowerks CodeWarrior for Win32</B>
<P>The prerequisites for compiling are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CodeWarrior Pro</DT>
<DD>Use version 5 or later.</DD>
<DT>CodeWarrior Pro Assembler Plugin</DT>
<DD>This tool isn't officially support by MetroWerks, but it functions fine
in conjunction with the project file included in the library.</DD>
</DL>
<P>To build, start the CodeWarrior IDE, open project file 'beecrypt.mcp'
and make the BeeCrypt DLL by pressing the <CODE>[F7]</CODE> key.
<P><B>Installing the BeeCrypt DLL</B>
<P>To install, either copy file 'beecrypt.dll' to your Windows System
directory (on Windows 95/98/Millenium), or to your Windows System 32
directory (on Windows NT/2000).
<P>If you don't need the BeeCrypt DLL globallly available, copy it into the same
directory as the application which is going to use it. If you intend to develop
software with BeeCrypt, you'll need file 'beecrypt.lib'. Either copy it into
project directory, or point your Makefile or project to it.
</DL>
</UL>
<BR>
<LI><B>Installing precompiled versions</B></LI>
<P>Several different flavors of precompiled versions exist.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Win32 BeeCrypt DLLs</DT>
<DD>Virtual Unlimited makes precompiled BeeCrypt DLL and LIB files, usable on
Pentium class processors. If you want to develop your own software with these
files, you will also need the header files from the source tarball. See
'Getting the source code'.</DD>
<DT>RedHat RPMS</DT>
<DD>Virtual Unlimited makes BeeCrypt RPM packages for every release for at
least the following platforms: i386, i586, i686, powerpc. As we get access to
more platforms, we will try to make more RPMS available; until then it
shouldn't be too hard to get the BeeCrypt SRPM file, install it and compile
your own RPMS from it. Note that RPM packages originating at Virtual
Unlimited will contain a signature, which you can verify with
<A HREF="http://www.virtualunlimited.com/support/beecrypt/gnupg-sigkey.html">
this key</A>.</DD>
<DT>Debian Packages</DT>
<DD>Thanks to Luca Filipozzi there are Debian packages available for BeeCrypt.
You can find these packages on various Debian mirror sites.</DD>
