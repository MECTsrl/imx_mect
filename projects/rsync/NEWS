NEWS for rsync 2.6.5 (1 Jun 2005)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.4:

  OUTPUT CHANGES:

    - Non-printable chars in filenames are now output using backslash-
      escaped characters rather than '?'s.  Any non-printable character is
      output using 3 digits of octal (e.g. "\n" -> "\012"), and a backslash
      is now output as "\\".  Rsync also uses your locale setting, which
      can make it treat fewer high-bit characters as non-printable.

    - If rsync received an empty file-list when pulling files, it would
      output a "nothing to do" message and exit with a 0 (success) exit
      status, even if the remote rsync returned an error (it did not do
      this under the same conditions when pushing files).  This was changed
      to make the pulling behavior the same as the pushing behavior:  we
      now do the normal end-of-run outputting (depending on options) and
      exit with the appropriate exit status.

  BUG FIXES:

    - A crash bug was fixed when a daemon had its "path" set to "/", did
      not have chroot enabled, and used some anchored excludes in the
      rsyncd.conf file.

    - Fixed a bug in the transfer of a single file when -H is specified
      (rsync would either infinite loop or perhaps crash).

    - Fixed a case where the generator might try (and fail) to tweak the
      write-permissions of a read-only directory in list-only mode (this
      only caused an annoying warning message).

    - If --compare-dest or --link-dest uses a locally-copied file as the
      basis for an updated version, log this better when --verbose or -i
      is in effect.

    - Fixed the accidental disabling of --backup during the --delete-after
      processing.

    - Restored the ability to use the --address option in client mode (in
      addition to its use in daemon mode).

    - Make sure that some temporary progress information from the delete
      processing does not get left on the screen when it is followed by a
      newline.

    - When --existing skips a directory with extra verbosity, refer to it
      as a "directory", not a "file".

    - When transferring a single file to a different-named file, any
      generator messages that are source-file related no longer refer to
      the file by the destination filename.

    - Fixed a bug where hard-linking a group of files might fail if the
      generator hasn't created a needed destination directory yet.

    - Fixed a bug where a hard-linked group of files that is newly-linked
      to a file in a --link-dest dir doesn't link the files from the rest
      of the cluster.

    - When deleting files with the --one-file-system (-x) option set, rsync
      no longer tries to remove files from inside a mount-point on the
      receiving side.  Also, we don't complain about being unable to remove
      the mount-point dir.

    - Fixed a compatibility problem when using --cvs-ignore (-C) and
      sending files to an older rsync without using --delete.

    - Make sure that a "- !" or "+ !" include/exclude pattern does not
      trigger the list-clearing action that is reserved for "!".

    - Avoid a timeout in the generator when the sender/receiver aren't
      handling the generator's checksum output quickly enough.

    - Fixed the omission of some directories in the delete processing when
      --relative (-R) was combined with a source path that had a trailing
      slash.

    - Fixed a case where rsync would erroneously delete some files and then
      re-transfer them when the options --relative (-R) and --recursive
      (-r) were both enabled (along with --delete) and a source path had a
      trailing slash.

    - Make sure that --max-size doesn't affect a device or a symlink.

    - Make sure that a system with a really small MAXPATHLEN does not cause
      the buffers in readfd_unbuffered() to be too small to receive normal
      messages.  (This mainly affected Cygwin.)

    - If a source pathname ends with a filename of "..", treat it as if
      "../" had been specified (so that we don't copy files to the parent
      dir of the destination).

    - If --delete is combined with a file-listing rsync command (i.e. no
      transfer is happening), avoid outputting a warning that we couldn't
      delete anything.

    - If --stats is specified with --delete-after, ensure that all the
      "deleting" messages are output before the statistics.

    - Improved one "if" in the deletion code that was only checking errno
      for ENOTEMPTY when it should have also been checking for EEXIST (for
      compatibility with OS variations).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --only-write-batch=FILE option that may be used (instead
      of --write-batch=FILE) to create a batch file without doing any
      actual updating of the destination.  This allows you to divert all
      the file-updating data away from a slow data link (as long as you
      are pushing the data to the remote server when creating the batch).

    - When the generator is taking a long time to fill up its output buffer
      (e.g. if the transferred files are few, small, or missing), it now
      periodically flushes the output buffer so that the sender/receiver
      can get started on the files sooner rather than later.

    - Improved the keep-alive code to handle a long silence between the
      sender and the receiver that can occur when the sender is receiving
      the checksum data for a large file.

    - Improved the auth-errors that are logged by the daemon to include
      some information on why the authorization failed:  wrong user,
      password mismatch, etc.  (The client-visible message is unchanged!)

    - Improved the client's handling of an "@ERROR" from a daemon so that
      it does not complain about an unexpectedly closed socket (since we
      really did expect the socket to close).

    - If the daemon can't open the log-file specified in rsyncd.conf, fall
      back to using syslog and log an appropriate warning.  This is better
      than what was typically a totally silent (and fatal) failure (since a
      daemon is not usually run with the --no-detach option that was
      necessary to see the error on stderr).

    - The man pages now consistently refer to an rsync daemon as a "daemon"
      instead of a "server" (to distinguish it from the server process in a
      non-daemon transfer).

    - Made a small change to the rrsync script (restricted rsync -- in the
      support dir) to make a read-only server reject all --remove-* options
      when sending files (to future-proof it against the possibility of
      other similar options being added at some point).

  INTERNAL:

    - Rsync now calls setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "").  This enables isprint() to
      better discern which filename characters need to be escaped in
      messages (which should result in fewer escaped characters in some
      locales).

    - Improved the naming of the log-file open/reopen/close functions.

    - Removed some protocol-compatibility code that was only needed to help
      someone running a pre-release of 2.6.4.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Added configure option "--disable-locale" to disable any use of
      setlocale() in the binary.

    - Fixed a bug in the SUPPORT{,_HARD}_LINKS #defines which prevented
      rsync from being built without symlink or hard-link support.

    - Only #define HAVE_REMSH if it is going to be set to 1.

    - Configure now disables the use of mkstemp() under HP-UX (since they
      refuse to fix its broken handling of large files).

    - Configure now explicitly checks for the lseek64() function so that
      the code can use HAVE_LSEEK64 instead of inferring lseek64()'s
      presence based on the presence of the off64_t type.

    - Configure no longer mentions the change in the default remote-shell
      (from rsh to ssh) that occurred for the 2.6.0 release.

    - Some minor enhancements to the test scripts.

    - Added a few new *.diff files to the patches dir, including a patch
      that enables the optional copying of extended attributes.
