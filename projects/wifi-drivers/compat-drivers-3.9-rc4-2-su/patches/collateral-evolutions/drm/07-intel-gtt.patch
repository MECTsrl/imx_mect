Kernels older than 3.6 don't have intel_enable_gtt() exported
and most Linux distributions have CONFIG_AGP_INTEL as built-in
(y) and as such we don't bother to make it available as
modular here. The change to export intel_enable_gtt() was
made through commit 8ecd1a66 but previous to this the driver
never called intel_enable_gtt() so we can safely assume we
can do the same for older kernels.

There should be a way to export an intel_enable_gtt() for
kernels with CONFIG_AGP_INTEL as built-in but that itself
is a project.

    drm/i915: call intel_enable_gtt
    
    When drm/i915 is in control of the gtt, we need to call
    the enable function at all the relevant places ourselves.
