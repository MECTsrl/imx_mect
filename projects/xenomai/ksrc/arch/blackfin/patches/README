-- arch/blackfin/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler, in the form
of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel tree,
before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the latter
kernel.

Apply the provided patch against the corresponding kernel
release/milestone. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.

On the Blackfin architecture, Xenomai is supported on the BF527,
BF533, BF537, BF548 and BF561(*) boards.

This directory only contains the most recent patches used to validate
this Xenomai release on Blackfin boards; you may find the complete
collection of Adeos/I-pipe patches at the following locations (see
note):

* http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/v2.6/blackfin/

* older I-pipe patches are available from:
http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/v2.6/blackfin/older/

NOTE: not all older patches are guaranteed to work with the current
Xenomai release.  However, there is a good chance most of them do,
since we try hard to maintain backward compatibility. In other words,
you are NOT absolutely required to upgrade your working kernel setup
to run this newer Xenomai release, albeit bugs have probably been
fixed in more recent I-pipe patches. YMMV.

The reference kernel tree the validated patches are based on varied
over time:

		Linux v2.6.30 to v2.6.31.6
